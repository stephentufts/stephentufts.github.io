Hello, my name is Stephen Tufts and I currently live in Vancouver, BC<br>
I own and operate a <a href="www.dickiesginger.com">small craft soda business</a><br>
Before that I worked at a <a href="www.amazon.com">big software company</a><br>
When I was younger I <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/">studied engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.gregfitzgerald.ca/2008/05/my-robot-guitar-player/">built some cool things</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Right now I think a lot about urbanism and how to make cities work better for small businesses<br>
If you'd like to chat <a href="mailto:stephen@stephentufts.com">drop me a line</a>
