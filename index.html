Hello! My name is Stephen Tufts and I currently live in Vancouver, BC<br>
I own a <a href="www.dickiesginger.com">small business</a><br>
Before that I worked at a <a href="www.amazon.com">big software company</a><br>
When I was younger I <a href="www.uwaterloo.ca">studied engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.gregfitzgerald.ca/2008/05/my-robot-guitar-player/">built some cool things</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Right now I'm thinking a lot about urbanism and how to make cities work better for small business.<br>
If you'd like to chat <a href="mailto:stephen@stephentufts.com">drop me a line</a>
